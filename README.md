# <b>Rocket Elevators Java API</b>

## <b> DESCRIPTION </b>

In this weeks project I had to create GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints using the Intellij app, Spring boot framework,Java language and Maven dependencies. 

## <b> DEPENDENCIES </b>

You will need the Intellij desktop app (Ultimate version(free 30-day trial)) and start a project with Maven.

For dependencies I had to start my project on the spring IO and add :
  
  -Spring Web
  -Spring Data JPA
  -MySQL Driver
  -Lombok (Helps reduce boilerplate code with the use of @Annotations)
  -Spring Boot Starter Validation
  
While doing the project I also had to download these dependencies :

  -Spring Security
  -jjwt
  
 For the Token Authentication.
 
 ## <b> GUIDE </b>
 
 Click on this link to see my PostMan collection --> "<a href=https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21930815/VUqoRzDT#5c55c1ab-92fb-4b23-85d9-829a09cdb617">
 Once in, click on the "Run in Postman"(top right corner) and test every endpoint created.
 Run the POST AUTHENTICATE to get the bearer token and in authorization just input the token. I've actually already implemented the token so you can just test them.
